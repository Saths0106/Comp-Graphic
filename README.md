# CS-330-Comp-Graphic

1. I approach designing software by starting with a basic idea of what I want the program to do and beginning there. In this class I was able to closely match assignments to tutorials for the week and I would utilize much of the code from the tutorials while changing what I needed to finish the assignment. 

2. I approach developing programs the same way, I figure out what I need the program to do and I try to write readable and efficient code that completes that task. I then go back through the code to see if I can find any bugs that might be hidden within the code and fix those. 

3. Computer science will help me reach my goals by making me a better software engineer and this class will help me with that because of the experience coding in C++. It is highly unlikely I will use openGL in my career and even more unlikely someone would pay me to do that but it is possible that I end up programming in C++ so any experience with the language is useful.
